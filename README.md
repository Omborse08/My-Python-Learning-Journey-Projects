# 🚀 My Python Learning Journey

Over the past few months, I have dedicated myself to learning **Python** step by step.  
Along the way, I built **30+ projects** — from beginner CLI apps to file handling systems,  
API integrations, and even some fun & creative experiments.  

This repository is a collection of all those projects, organized neatly in folders.  
It reflects my growth and consistency as I move towards becoming an **ML Engineer**. 💡
